## 01/03/2020 - Version 0.20.0

This release focussed on improving Protobuf support, introducing a number of new
features and bug fixes but also some breaking changes.

New features/improvements/bug fixes:

* Scala reserved words are now escaped properly in generated code, so you can
  safely use words such as `type` or `private` in your Protobuf definitions.

* Type names in generated code are now fully qualified, so use of words such as
  `Option` or `Either` in your Protobuf definitions will not cause name clashes
  with other Scala types.

* The sbt plugin no longer includes unnecessary imports in generated code. For
  example, if your RPC endpoints do not make use of streaming, the generated
  code will not include any FS2 or Monix imports.

* Protobuf enums are now supported. They are encoded as [enumeratum](https://github.com/lloydmeta/enumeratum)
  `IntEnum`s in the generated code.

* Protobuf `oneof` fields are now supported. They are encoded as
  [Shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless) Coproduct types in the
  generated code.

* Field numbers are now respected when encoding/decoding Protobuf messages. This
  is important if you want your Mu server or client to communicate correctly
  with 3rd parties using Protobuf.

* Default values for Protobuf scalar fields are now supported correctly. When
  reading a message with a missing field, the field is correctly instantiated
  with the default value for its type. When writing a message, a field is
  skipped if it has the default value. See [this
  table](https://github.com/47deg/pbdirect/blob/a9eee69a90d424889fd3eb421babb07f87f9495b/README.md#default-values-and-missing-fields)
  for more details about default values for various types.

* Repeated Protobuf fields with primitive types are now encoded using the
  [packed
  encoding](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#packed)
  by default, for compliance with the `proto3` spec.

* A new `srcGenStreamingImplementation` setting has been added to the sbt
  plugin, allowing you to choose which streaming implementation (FS2 or Monix)
  to use when generating code.  Previously this was hardcoded to FS2 and not
  configurable. See [the
  docs](https://higherkindness.io/mu-scala/generate-sources-from-idl#plugin-settings)
  for more details.

Breaking changes:

* We have fixed a number of bugs in Protobuf encoding/decoding, and we now have
  a test suite to check that Mu's Protobuf encoding matches that of `protoc`,
  the official Protobuf CLI tool. However, this means that clients and servers
  using Mu v0.20.0 or newer will not be able to communicate with older versions
  of Mu via Protobuf.

* The Protobuf encoders and decoders for `java.time` classes (`LocalDate`,
  `LocalDateTime` and `Instant`) and joda-time classes (`LocalDate` and
  `LocalDateTime`) have been simplified. They now encode values as `int32` or
  `int64` instead of converting them to byte arrays. This is consistent with the
  equivalent Avro encoders/decoders.

* If you define any Protobuf codecs for custom types, you now need to define
  instances of `PBScalarValueReader` and/or `PBScalarValueWriter` instead of
  `PBReader`/`PBWriter`. See [the
  docs](https://higherkindness.io/mu-scala/core-concepts#custom-codecs) for an
  example.

* Using a simple type (e.g. `Boolean`, `String`, `LocalDate`) as an RPC request
  or response is no longer supported for Protobuf services. Only proper message
  types (i.e. case classes) are allowed.
