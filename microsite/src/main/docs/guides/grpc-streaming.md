# gRPC Streaming

In the [tutorials](../tutorials), we only defined gRPC services with so-called
"unary" endpoints. This is an endpoint that does not involve streaming. The
client sends a single request and receives a single response.

[gRPC] also defines the following kinds of streaming, all of which are supported
by Mu.

* **Server streaming RPC**: similar to the unary service, but in this case the
  server will send back a stream of responses for a client request.
* **Client streaming RPC**: in this case is the client which sends a stream of
  requests. The server will respond with a single response.
* **Bidirectional streaming RPC**: a mix of server and client streaming as both
  sides will be sending a stream of data.

## Protobuf

Mu only officially supports streaming for Protobuf, not Avro. This is because
Avro does not (yet) have support for streaming RPC endpoints in its protocol
specification.

The relevant Avro issue is
[AVRO-406](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-406).

## Stream implementation

Mu uses [FS2
Stream](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2) for streaming of
RPC requests and responses.

## Service definition with streaming endpoints

Let's see what a Mu RPC service definition looks like when we introduce
streaming endpoints.

Before starting, here is one import we'll need:

```scala mdoc:silent
import higherkindness.mu.rpc.protocol._
```

And here are the request/response models for our service:

```scala mdoc:silent
case class HelloRequest(greeting: String)

case class HelloResponse(reply: String)
```

We'll write the service definition using FS2.

### Using FS2

Let's write the same service definition using `fs2.Stream` instead of `Observable`.

```scala mdoc:silent
object servicefs2 {

  import fs2.Stream

  @service(Protobuf)
  trait Greeter[F[_]] {

    /**
     * Server streaming RPC
     *
     * @param request Single client request.
     * @return Stream of server responses.
     */
    def lotsOfReplies(request: HelloRequest): F[Stream[F, HelloResponse]]

    /**
     * Client streaming RPC
     *
     * @param request Stream of client requests.
     * @return Single server response.
     */
    def lotsOfGreetings(request: Stream[F, HelloRequest]): F[HelloResponse]

    /**
     * Bidirectional streaming RPC
     *
     * @param request Stream of client requests.
     * @return Stream of server responses.
     */
    def bidiHello(request: Stream[F, HelloRequest]): F[Stream[F, HelloResponse]]

  }

}
```
